Grisu is a grid job submission client that, very much like a web portal, enables the user to submit jobs to the grid. Like most grid clients, it supports and implements a generic, application-independent workflow like the one pictured on the left.

Some of its features:

? communicates via web services to avoid firewall problems
? uses MyProxy credentials (username/password) to connect to the grid
? has several client implementations (at the moment a Java Swing and a command line client)
? uses a XML templating system to be able to support multiple applications. Grid administrators, developers and users can add the application/submission type they need relatively easy
? it is extendable via Java plugins to improve the support for specific applications
? comes with rudimentary file management support to enable the user to stage/move files outside the job submission workflow
? can be used as library to add grid job submission/file staging features to existing (Java) applications
