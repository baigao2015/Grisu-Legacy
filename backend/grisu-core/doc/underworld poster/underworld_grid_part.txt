---++ What can the Grid do for Underworld? 

Running simulations of the above-mentioned models is an expensive process.
Current generation models require solving systems of several million
unknowns over 100+ timesteps. This necessitates running large parallel
jobs - using 64 processors, a medium-large model run takes in excess of ten hours. But as well as this compute-time expense, there is the time
spent setting up, monitoring, and post-processing batch jobs on supercomputers.

Grid computing offers the potential to launch, monitor, and post-process
many compute jobs simultaneously, all from a graphical user interface or
web portal. Clearly, Underworld researchers could benefit from these
capabilities. Specifically, the core needs for an Underworld grid service
can be described as:

 * submitting underworld jobs to the grid
 * staging in input files from either the desktop, or remote sources such as the shared directory of a user's VO
 * monitoring and managing running jobs - including viewing intermediate results
 * staging out output files to the desktop/home directory of a user's site/shared directories of their VO(s)
