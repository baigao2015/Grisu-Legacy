---++ Computational Geodynamics: the Stg-Underworld Framework

StGermain-to-Underworld is a layered framework for modelling geodynamic
systems, with an emphasis on achieving scalability on high performance computing (HPC) clusters.
While the lower layers of the framework such as StGermain are quite
abstract, Underworld itself is designed to support the particular
needs of key problems in contemporary geodynamics, such as subduction
of tectonic plates, thermal and thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle,
and basin extension. See www.mcc.monash.edu.au/Software/Underworld and www.stgermainproject.org for further information about the framework.
