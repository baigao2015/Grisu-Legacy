Over the past year we have found the following are important foundations for setting up a
grid service for Underworld:

* developing good communications between the grid application/middleware and scientific
  application developers. For example, as a result of discussions with the CSIRO APAC Grid Geoscience Support Project team,
  Underworld's input file system was streamlined to remove the need for multiple input
  files with absolute links between them
* developing a clear naming convention and roadmap for our releases, and liasing with
  APAC to keep the central registry of installed releases updated
* working closely with supercomputer system administrators to keep the latest release successfully installed as a module. This includes providing system tests to allow testing installation
 quickly & reliably
* beta-testing Grid clients over university networks, to ensure firewalls and proxies can
  be successfully navigated
* involving the scientific application's users in the process. For example, the APAC Grid Geosciences Project Roadshow acted a catalyst for several users to commence beta-testing of grid clients with Underworld
* providing online documentation to assist users in connecting to the grid - see http://www.mcc.monash.edu.au/Software/UnderWorldOnAPACGrid.
